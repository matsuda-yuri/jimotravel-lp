            Users may withdraw (delete their account) via the prescribed procedure within this App.<br>
            After withdrawal, we will in principle delete data linked to the user, and it may not be recoverable
            (however, we may retain it for a certain period to the extent necessary for legal compliance, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, etc.).<br>
            If you had been sharing travel logs, after withdrawal the recipient may no longer be able to view them, and display/provision may be restricted.
